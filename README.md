## 🧑‍💻 About Me
- 🌱 Forever a seeker, I chase the endless horizons of technology. Nothing escapes my curious gaze! 👀
- 📖 A CS student by day, a dreamer by night—crafting code that whispers beauty and chaos into the void.
- ⚡ My peculiar fascinations:
  - 📚 Novels & poetry—where words are galaxies, and I’m lost among the stars. (Yes, I romanticize *everything*.)
  - ☕ Coffee—the elixir of life, brewed dark enough to mirror my late-night debugging sessions.
  - 🦉 Owls—wise observers of the night, peering into your soul... but only if they like you.
  - 🌍 Languages—each one a new spell to weave meaning into the world. My progress bar:
    - 🇺🇦 Ukrainian – native (my mother tongue, my roots 🌻)
    - 🇷🇺 Russian – a chapter I’d rather close.
    - 🇬🇧 English – C1 and climbing, fueled by books and memes.
    - 🇫🇷 French – B1, mais j’y mets tout mon cœur !
    - 🇯🇵 Japanese – just a vibe I can’t resist ✨

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools
### 💬 Languages I Whisper To (Computers Mostly)
- 🔷 **TypeScript** – my spellbook for crafting web magic with React & its pals.
- ⚛️ **JavaScript** – the old friend I still call when TypeScript’s feeling shy.
- 🐍 **Python** – for when I want my code to feel elegant and serpentine.
- ☕ **Java** – where I brew object-oriented wonders (with a pinch of Kotlin spice).
- 💻 **C / C++** – digging deep into the machinery of thoughts.
- 🦀 **Rust** – the siren song I’m drawn to, but haven’t yet embraced (soon... 👀).

### 🧱 Frameworks & Libraries
- ⚛️ **React & React Native** – my go-to for painting the web and mobile dreams.
- 🌶️ **Flask** – for serving up backends with a sprinkle of spice.
- 🧊 **Qt** – a playground for crafting desktop wonders.
- ☕ **JavaFX** – where I'm learning to breathe life into Java GUIs.

### 🧰 Tools of the Trade
- 🧠 **Git** – because my memory is as unreliable as a non-commit.
- ⚡ **Vite** – as fast as my midnight ideas (but more structured).
- 🎨 **Sass** – because plain CSS is like painting with one color.
- 🔥 **Firebase** – for dreams that need real-time sparks.
- 📄 **Markdown** – my paper and pen in the digital realm.
- 🎮 **Godot Engine** – the canvas for my indie game aspirations.

> Yeah, I know—I’m crazy for trying to learn *everything*. But what’s life without a bit of chaos? Can’t wait to expand this list with even more tools and tech. 🌌
