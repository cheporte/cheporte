# Salut à tous ! 👋

I'm Cheporté (or Ché-Ché for short)—just a humble guy who loves making things over-complicated and can't get enough of world's wonders.

## 🧑‍💻 Un Peu De Moi
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Nothing shall escape my sight! :D
- 📖 Currently a CS student dreaming of creating something wild and beautiful with code.
- ⚡ My interests:
  - 📚 Novels & poetry (yes, I do romanticize everything)
  - ☕ Coffee (the darker the better—also my blood type now)
  - 🦉 Owls (they see through you... in a good way)
  - 🌍 Languages fascinate me. Here's my progress bar:
    - 🇺🇦 Ukrainian – native
    - 🇷🇺 Russian – wish I never knew it
    - 🇬🇧 English – C1 and counting
    - 🇫🇷 French – B1, mais je fais de mon mieux !
    - 🇯🇵 Japanese – want to learn just for the vibes ✨

## 🔧 Technologies et Outils
### 💬 Languages I Speak (to computers, mostly)
- 🔷 TypeScript (my main jam for web stuff with React & co.)
- 🐍 Python
- ⚛️ JavaScript (still hanging around, but TypeScript's the star)
- ☕ Java (with sprinkles of Kotlin)
- 💻 C / C++
- 🦀 Eager to dive into Rust (one day... soon 👀)

### 🧱 Frameworks & Libraries
- ⚛️ React & React Native
- 🌶️ Flask
- 🧊 Qt (I'm quite into it)
- ☕ Currently learning JavaFX

### 🧰 Other Tools I Like
- 🧠 Git (because memory is overrated)
- ⚡ Vite (blazingly fast, like my ideas at 3AM)
- 🎨 Sass (indented flavor, of course)
- 🔥 Firebase (for auth & realtime dreams)
- 📄 Markdown (used more than Word at this point)
- 🎮 Godot Engine (my cozy playground)


Yeah, I'm crazy—I try to learn as much as possible. Can't wait to extend this whole list with even more knowledge :+)

## 🌟 Mes Projets
### 🧠 [Mephisto](https://github.com/saisenko/mephisto)
> An "IDE" for RISC-V programming.  
> A resurrection of my old [riscv-translator](https://github.com/cheporte/riscv-translator) project—this time powered by the Qt framework instead of Kotlin.  
Think of it as: if low-level had a spa day.
